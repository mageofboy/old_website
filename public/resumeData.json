    "bio":"Hello~ I'm Eric. I'm currently a Sophomore at UC Berkeley. I came into Berkeley intending to study Biology and pursue the pre-med route for medical school. However, out of interest, I decided to take a Computer Science class and I enjoyed the class so much that decided to study Computer Science instead. Despite aiming to work in the industry as a Software Engineer, I still partake in research in areas related to Biology though I contribute to projects primarily through developing computational applications. ",
    "life":" Besides my interest in the intersection between Biology and Computer Science, I am fond of Full Stack Development as a result of prior classes and projects in Web Development. Currently, I'm trying to develop my skills in Full Stack by acting as a Web Committee Director of Berkeley's local IEEE chapter.",
